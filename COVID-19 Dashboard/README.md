# COVID-19 Dashboard

I have developed a simple dashboard from the COVID-19 data source. The data source contains dates of covid cases confirmed, recovered and total deaths. 

Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/niteesh.chanabasanavar/viz/COVID-19Dashboard_16751986299320/COVID-19Dashboard) to view the dashboard.

Alternatively, you can see the snapshot of the dashboard below.
